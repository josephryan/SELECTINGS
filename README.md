# SELECTINGS
A pipeline to detect positive Darwinian selection in large datasets

The detection of positive Darwinian selection enables the identification of important changes in protein-coding regions of a genome that helped shape the evolutionary history of a particular lineage. Despite the availability of coding sequence data for many thousands of species, it remains a challenge to conduct large-scale selection analyses on broad collections of sequence data. To address this gap, we have developed a pipeline that allows for the analysis of an unlimited number of genes from an unlimited number of assembled transcriptomes and/or gene models gathered from genomic datasets. The SELECTINGS (Screening Evolutionary Lineages for Exceptional Coding Transcripts In Next Generation Sequence) Pipeline incorporates several existing bioinformatic packages for translating transcriptomes (Transdecoder), identifying orthologous sequences (OrthoFinder), aligning sequences (MAFFT), building gene trees (FastTree or IQTree), pruning trees (PhyloPyPruner), converting protein alignments to nucleotide alignments (PAL2NAL), detecting gene and site-based evidence of positive selection (comparable branch-site tests in PAML and HyPhy). This repo includes a set of scripts, documentation, sample data, installation instructions , and a tutorial. Compared to other similar tools, the SELECTINGS Pipeline allows for greater flexibility in terms of methodology, number of genes that can be analyzed, and the phylogenetic breadth that can be sampled.
